Imagine you're facing a really tough problem. Unfortunately, it's so tough that finding an exact solution seems to take forever, or maybe it's even impossible in a reasonable amount of time.
• What do you do?
• You could settle for a good guess or an almost-perfect solution in polynomial time rather than spending too much time looking for the perfect one. That's where approximation algorithms come in.
• Approximation algorithms find approximate solutions to o**ptimization problems (NP-hard)** with provable guarantees on the distance of the returned solution to the optimal one.

- Appriximation algorithm finds approximate solutions to optimization problems (NP - hard ) with provable gurantees on the distance of the returned solution to optimal one
- An n-approximation algorithm means the result of the algorithm is not
going to be worse than n times the optimal solution (for minimization).

# Approximation Algorithms - Facts

Runs in polynomial time

Has a performance guarantee (by performance ratio)

Each approximation algorithm is different, depending on the problem

A few approx. algorithms design techniques:

Greedy algorithm

Local search

Dynamic programming

Linear programming
