**BackTracking :**

Backtracking is a problem-solving technique used to find all possible
solutions to a problem.
• It explores different possibilities step by step and **abandons a solution**
as soon as it is determined to be incorrect.
• Backtracking is often used for problems w*here brute force is not
feasible due to the problem size*

**How backtracking works? :**
• Start with an empty solution and gradually build it.
• At each step, make a choice and proceed.
• If the current choice doesn't lead to a valid solution, backtrack to the
previous step and make a different choice.
• Continue this process until a valid solution is found or all possibilities
are explored
