# Divide & Conqure

**Introduction**

- **Divide & Conquer** is a **paradigm** for solving problems.
- It is a **recursive** algorithm design paradigm.
- It works by **breaking down** a problem into **two or more** sub-problems of the **same or related type**, until these become simple enough to be solved directly.
- The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.
- The **divide-and-conquer** technique is the basis of efficient algorithms for many problems, such as **sorting** (e.g., quicksort, merge sort), **multiplication**, and **searching**.
- There are three steps to solve a problem using **Divide & Conquer**:
    1. **Divide**: Break the given problem into subproblems of same type.
    2. **Conquer**: Recursively solve these subproblems.
    3. **Combine**: Appropriately combine the answers.
