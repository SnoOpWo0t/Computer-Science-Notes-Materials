    The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a method for **finding all primes** up to (and possibly including) a given natural . n . This method works well when is relatively small,Â **allowing us to determine whether any natural number less than or equal to is prime or composite**
    
    time complexity is : $n sqrt(n)$
