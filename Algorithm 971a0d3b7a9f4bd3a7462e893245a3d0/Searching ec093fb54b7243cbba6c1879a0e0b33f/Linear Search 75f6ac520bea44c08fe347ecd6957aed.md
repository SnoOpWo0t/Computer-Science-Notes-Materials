# Linear Search

- Linear Search in sorted way
- Linear Search in unsorted way
- Linear Search in Sorted Array

### why Linear Search?

1. most Basic
2. easy to impleament
3. Array doesn’t have to be  Sorted
4. All Array elements

### Algorithm :

1. Take how many inputs to take
2. take input in array in loop
3. take distinct input
4. take another variable  for index

### Linear Search Algorithm when usorted:

1. find first occurrence
2. find last “”
3. find  all “”
4. find all ocurence and replace wirh  a new value

### Algorithm when sorted:

1. While checking array  if the elements turns greater than targeted elements then its not matched
2. if the list is unsorted we have to search all numbers before we declare that the target is not present in array
3. if the list is sorted we can stop as soon as we reach a number that is greater than our target
4. 

**After Getting desired Search linear search terminate Searching**
