# Bellman-Ford (No negative-Cycle)

- What is **Negative Cycle?**
    
    one point to another point value can be in negative. but the ultimate cost of that Cycle cant be in negative

### DrawBacks of BellmanFord

if thereâ€™s a cycle in graph and if the summation of cycle is in **negative.** then in bellmaanford equation wont [work.in](http://work.in) every equation last iterate value will alwayds increase

Bellman will work when the summation of cycle edge is in positive
