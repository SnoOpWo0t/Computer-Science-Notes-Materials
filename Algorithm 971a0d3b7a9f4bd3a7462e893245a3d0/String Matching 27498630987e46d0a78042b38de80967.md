String matching is the process of finding the occurrence (or occurrences) of a particular pattern (substring) within a given string. Also known as
• Substring matching
• Pattern matching

### – **Applications :**

1. **Text Search Engines**: String matching algorithms are fundamental to text search engines like Google, Bing, and others. They efficiently retrieve documents containing specific words or phrases from vast collections of data.
2. **Spell Checkers**: In spell checkers, string matching algorithms help identify and correct misspelled words by suggesting alternative words that closely match the input.
3. **Plagiarism Detection**: String matching algorithms are used to detect plagiarism by comparing documents and identifying similarities in their text.
4. **Genomics and Bioinformatics**: In genomics and bioinformatics, string matching algorithms are used to compare DNA or protein sequences, enabling tasks like sequence alignment and identification of similarities between genetic sequences.
5. **Data Compression**: String matching algorithms play a crucial role in data compression techniques such as Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression, which is used in applications like file compression (e.g., ZIP files).
6. **Data Mining and Information Retrieval**: String matching algorithms are used in data mining and information retrieval tasks to find patterns and extract relevant information from large datasets, such as analyzing social media data or mining web pages.
7. **Network Security**: Intrusion detection systems and firewall applications often use string matching algorithms to detect and block malicious patterns or signatures in network traffic, such as viruses, worms, or denial-of-service attacks.
8. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: String matching algorithms are used in NLP tasks such as named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and language translation, where identifying patterns and similarities in text is crucial.
9. **Pattern Recognition**: In pattern recognition tasks like optical character recognition (OCR) and speech recognition, string matching algorithms help identify and interpret patterns in images or audio signals.
10. **Compiler Design**: String matching algorithms are used in compilers to perform lexical analysis, where they tokenize the source code by identifying keywords, identifiers, and other syntactic elements.
