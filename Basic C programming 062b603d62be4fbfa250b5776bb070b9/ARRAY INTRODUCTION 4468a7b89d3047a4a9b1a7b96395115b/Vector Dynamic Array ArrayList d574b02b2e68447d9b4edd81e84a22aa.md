# Vector || Dynamic Array || ArrayList  :

### **Vector || Dynamic Array :**

**ArrayList is Dynamic , and it only use for each loop and iterator**

**vector<data type> variable_name**

**variable.size()**

**in vector we push back/insert elements v.push_back()**

- Vector is  a dynamic , can store unlimited data  in vector

**Vector is a sequential container to store elements and not index based.**
**Array stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type and it is index based**
. Vector is dynamic in nature so, size increases with insertion of elements. As array is fixed size, once initialized can't be resized.

vector print in 2 ways :

1. normal iteration
2. inhance forloop

**we use auto keyword so that compiler automaticaly determine its data_type**

**Set is a container whose length is dynamic,itsâ€™ main usage is finding how many distinct number in vector     :       set<data_type>variable**
