# Structures, Unions & Enums

### To create stucture :

- A **Structure is a Collection of predefined datatypes** (int ,float, double)
Structures help in creating **user defined data type**

**Define Structure :**

- **struct**  - tag
{
     **Structure Members**
} ;
- **Structures : is a** compound data_type which has similar or dissimilar primitive data_types, The structure is also called user defined data types
1. **{  }** is called Bundle
    1. Structure :
    **typedef struct structure name
    {
       ( take a couple of variable that has same or different data type)
    } Bundle_name** (shortcut of structure name for convenience) ;
2. size of the new data type will be the sum of the combined variable
3. it must be written above the main function
4. we use **dot operato**r (member operator ) to differentiated structure data type variables
5. scanf(&p.x , &p.y &q.x,&q.y)

**In nested structure we have to access inner structure with outer structure.**

- **Why/What of padding ?**
