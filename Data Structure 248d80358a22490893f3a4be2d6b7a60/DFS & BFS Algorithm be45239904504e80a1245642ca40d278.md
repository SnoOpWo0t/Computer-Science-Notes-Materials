### Breadth First  Search

1. **Queue is used**
2. jei vertice niye kaj korbo tar adjacent vertices queue te insert hobe
3. already visited vertices notun kore insert hobena.
4. inserted vertices reapeat hobena
5. **find the shortest graph in the unweighted graph**
6. **one vertex at a time**
7. expand frontier of explored vertices
8. pick a source vertex to be a root
9. find it’s children and then their children

- **Applications of BFS**
    1. find the shortest path in undirected / directed unweighted graph
    2. find the bipartitense of a graph
    3. find the connectedness of a graph
    

### DEPTH FIRST SEARCH

1. **Stack is used**
2. BackTracking
3. Tropological sort
4. find strongly connected components

**Forward EDGE :** from ancestor to descendent
(**X appears before Y we’’ll know this by checking starting time. lesser time means appears before, and there is a path from X to Y**)

**Back Edge :**from descendent to ancestor…. (**Y appears before X we’’ll know this by checking starting time. lesser time means appears before, and there is a path from Y to X**)

**Cross edge : b**etween a tree or subtrees… Edge will be (X,Y) but there’ll **be no path**

**Self loops are considered as to be back edge.**

    Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) are two fundamental algorithms used for traversing or searching through graph data structures. The choice between DFS and BFS depends on the specific problem you are trying to solve and the nature of the graph you are working with.
    
    ### Depth First Search (DFS):
    
    DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack data structure to remember the next vertex to visit from the current vertex. DFS is typically implemented using recursion.
    
    Use DFS when:
    
    1. **You want to visit nodes as deeply as possible along each branch.**
    2. **You are interested in paths or finding cycles in the graph.**
    3. **Memory usage is a concern, as DFS can be more memory efficient compared to BFS.**
    
    ### Breadth First Search (BFS):
    
    BFS explores all the vertices at the present depth before moving on to vertices at the next depth level. It uses a queue data structure to remember the next vertex to visit from the current vertex.
    
    Use BFS when:
    
    1. **You want to find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.**
    2. **You need to visit all nodes in the graph with the minimum number of edges.**
    3. **Memory usage is not a concern, as BFS can consume more memory compared to DFS due to its use of a queue.**
    
    In summary, use DFS for tasks involving exploration of all possibilities, like maze-solving, topological sorting, or cycle detection. Use BFS when you need to find the shortest path or need to explore nodes in layers, such as in web crawling or social network analysis where you want to find connections with the fewest intermediaries.
    
    Ultimately, the choice between DFS and BFS depends on the problem requirements and the specific characteristics of the graph you are dealing with.
    
    Certainly, let's delve deeper into the specific scenarios where you might prefer to use Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) based on their properties:
    
    ### Depth First Search (DFS):
    
    1. **Maze Solving:**
        - DFS is often used to explore all possible paths in a maze until it finds the solution. It can go very deep into one branch before backtracking, which is useful for exploring complex mazes.
    2. **Topological Sorting:**
        - DFS is used to find a topological ordering in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This ordering is crucial in scheduling tasks with dependencies or in compilers' symbol table construction.
    3. **Cycle Detection:**
        - DFS is excellent for detecting cycles in a graph. If during DFS, you encounter an already visited node while exploring, then a cycle exists.
    4. **Pathfinding in Graphs:**
        - DFS can be modified to find a path from one node to another. While it doesn’t guarantee the shortest path, it can be useful in certain scenarios where the path's length isn’t the primary concern.
    5. **Memory Efficiency:**
        - DFS typically uses less memory as compared to BFS because it only needs to remember the current path and can use recursion, which utilizes the call stack.
    
    ### Breadth First Search (BFS):
    
    1. **Shortest Path in Unweighted Graph:**
        - BFS guarantees the shortest path from the source node to all other nodes in an unweighted graph. If you need to find the shortest route, BFS is the way to go.
    2. **Web Crawling:**
        - When indexing web pages, BFS is used to explore web pages level by level. This ensures that closer, more relevant pages are indexed first.
    3. **Social Network Analysis:**
        - BFS is useful in finding connections in social networks. For example, finding the shortest chain of connections between two people on a social media platform.
    4. **State Space Search:**
        - BFS can be applied in problems like the Eight Puzzle game or the N-Queens problem, where you are searching for a sequence of moves or placements that lead to a solution.
    5. **Connected Components:**
        - BFS can be used to find connected components in an undirected graph, i.e., groups of nodes where each node is reachable from any other node in the same group.
    
    In essence, if you need to explore broadly (e.g., finding the shortest path, exploring neighbors), BFS is a better choice. If you need to dive deep into possibilities, explore complex paths, or detect cycles, DFS is more appropriate. The selection between DFS and BFS boils down to the specific requirements of your problem and the characteristics of the graph you are dealing with.
