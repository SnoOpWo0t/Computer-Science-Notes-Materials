# Heap & Heapify

**Heap :** 

A heap is a All most complete binary tree and Left Focused(**every node has 2 node nad last node has to have a left node** ) except the bottom level adjusted to the left.The value of each node is greater than that of its two children. (Max Heap). The value of each node is less than that of its two children. (Min Heap). Height of the heapÂ  is log2n.

**Complexity of Heapsort** 

Heap Sort takes O(nlog2n ) times.

Reasons:

1. BuildHeap from the initial array requires O(nlog2n).
2. Delete-Max n times requires n x O(log2n) = O(nlog2n).
