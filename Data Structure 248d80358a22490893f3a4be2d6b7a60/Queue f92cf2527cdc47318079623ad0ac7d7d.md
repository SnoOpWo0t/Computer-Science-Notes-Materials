# Queue

- **Queue** = **FIFO** data structure **(First in First out)** and its a **linear data structure**
    
    in java **queue is a interface not class. we can instantiate queue itself because its an interface  so we need to use Linked list**
    
    1. **add** =enqueue, **offer()**
    2.  **remove** = dequeue, **poll()**
    3. .contains() = to check if the element is inside stack or not
    
    Queue class extend collection class. so the queue class inherits everything that a collection class has
    
    ### Priority queue :
    
    highest priority first before elements with lower priority
    
    by default, a **`PriorityQueue` in Java works in ascending order**, meaning elements with lower priority/smaller elements values will be dequeued first. smaller elements will have higher priority.
    
    However, if you want to use a **`PriorityQueue`** with elements (l**arger elements having higher priority)**, you can provide a custom comparator to the constructor like reverse order
    
    **`java.util.Collections.reverseOrder()`** 
    
    ```java
    import java.util.PriorityQueue;  import java.util.Queue;
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Queue<Double> queue = new PriorityQueue<>(java.util.Collections.reverseOrder());
            queue.offer(34.4);
            queue.offer(34.6);
            while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
                System.out.println(queue.poll())     } }}
    When you run this code, it will:
    
    1. Create a priority queue with elements in reverse order.
    2. Add the numbers 34.4 and 34.6 to the queue.
    3. Start a loop that continues until the queue is empty.
    4. In each iteration of the loop, remove and print the highest priority element (largest number) from the queue.
    5. The loop will exit when the queue becomes empty.
    ```
    
    In **C++,** the **`std::priority_queue`** container is by **default a max heap,** meaning it s**tores the elements in descending order**. To achieve a priority queue with ascending order, we can use the **`std::greater`** comparator
