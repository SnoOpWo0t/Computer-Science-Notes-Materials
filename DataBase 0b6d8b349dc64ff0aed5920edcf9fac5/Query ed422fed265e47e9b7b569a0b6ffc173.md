# Query

### Queury

a query is simply a request for information. Similarly, the meaning of a query in database management is **a request for data**. If you need to access, manipulate, delete, or retrieve data from your relational database, you'll need a database query written using a specific syntax.

1. **Select queries • :**
    
    Select query is the simplest and the most common type of query. It retrieves data from one or more tables depending on what is needed and displays the result in a datasheet.
    
2. **Action queries •** 
    
    Action queries are **a way to change the data in your database**. 
    An action query can **append**, **delete,** or **update data**, or **make a new table** using existing data. Action queries are very powerful, but that power entails some risk of unintended data changes.
    
3. **Parameter queries •**
4. **Crosstab queries •** 
    
    crosstab query **calculates a sum, average, or other aggregate function, and then groups the results by two sets of values**— one set on the side of the datasheet and the other set across the top.
    

**SQL queries**. Select
