### Relational DataBase Management

**Relation == TABLE**

1. **One to one →** 
2. **one to many** → *primary key of one table has to be the foreign key of other table
[a foreign key defines relationships between tables]*
3. **Mnay to many → it requires anothe table called junction table** which conects all the table

***Condition for Relationa DB :***
***** minimum **one common field** has to be present
***** inside relational table at least one table must have **Primary key field**

- primary key is going to be unique for each row of table
