# Interface

1. Function interface has only one method 

## What is Interface

Interface is just like classs which contains **only abstract method** . to achive interface java provides a keyword **implements**

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ 1. interface **methods** are by default **public and abstract**
2. Interface variable are by default **PUBLIC + STATIC + FINAL**
3. interface methodss must be overriden inside the implementing classes
4. interface mothing but deals between client and developer
5. **Interfaces can only have abstract methods**

</aside>

## **Why need interface**

Syntax :
**public interface class_name {**

             //INTERFACE METHOD
**}**

Syntax for multiple inheritance through interface :
**public class class_name implements  interface_name1 , interface_name2 {
          public void interface1 method () {
}
          public void interface2_method () {
}
}**

**Avoiding Diamond Problem**: Java avoids the "**diamond proble**m," which occurs in languages that support multiple inheritance with classes. The diamond problem arises when a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. With interfaces, there's no ambiguity because classes are explicitly implementing interfaces, and there's no confusion about which superclass should take precedence.

## Difference between Abstract and interface

**All the variable inside interface is by default Final & Static**

**Similarities** between interface and class :

1. both can have any number of method
2. same .java extention

**Difference :**
1.  canâ€™t instantiate / create object in interface

1. doesnâ€™t contain constructor
2. all method in interface are abstract
3. canâ€™t j=have instance variables
4. can extend multiple interface

Abstraction and interfaces in Java both enable the creation of abstract blueprints for classes:

- **Abstraction (Abstract Classes):**
    - Allows abstract (unimplemented) and concrete (implemented) methods.
    - Can have instance variables and constructors.
    - Classes extend abstract classes, implementing abstract methods.
- **Interfaces:**
    - Contains only abstract methods (prior to Java 8; default and static methods introduced later).
    - Cannot have instance variables or constructors.
    - Classes implement interfaces, providing implementations for all methods.

**Similarities:**

- Both provide abstract structures.
- Both enforce method implementations in derived classes.
- Both support polymorphism and can be used as reference types.

In summary, abstraction (via abstract classes) and interfaces serve as abstract templates, ensuring method implementations in derived classes while allowing polymorphic usage.
